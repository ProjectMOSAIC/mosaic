Description: Data sets and utilities from Project MOSAIC (http://mosaic-web.org)
    used to teach mathematics, statistics, computation and modeling. Funded by the
    NSF, Project MOSAIC is a community of educators working to tie together aspects
    of quantitative work that students in science, technology, engineering and
    mathematics will need in their professional lives, but which are usually taught
    in isolation, if at all.
