This vignette describes related resources and materials useful for teaching
statistics with a focus on modeling and computation.

## Package Vignettes

The `mosaic` package includes a number of vignettes. These are available 
from within R or from 
[cran.r-project.org/package=mosaic](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mosaic).

 * *Minimal R* describes a minimal set of R commands for use in 
	Introductory Statistics and discusses why it is important
		to keep the set of commands small;
		
 * *Less Volume, More Creativity*, based on slides from an 
	ICOTS 2014 workshop, introduces the `mosaic` package and related tools 
	and describes some of the philosophy behind the design choices made in the 
	`mosaic` package. 
	
 * *Graphics with with the mosaic package* is gallery of plots made 
	using tools from the `mosaic` package.
	
 * *Resampling methods in R* demonstrates how to use the `mosaic`
	package to compute p-values for randomization tests and bootstrap confidence 
	intervals in a number of common situations. The examples are based on the 
	``resamping bake off'' at USCOTS 2013.

 * *ggformula/lattice conversion examples* compares the lattice and ggformula formula interfaces for creating graphics: https://cran.r-project.org/package=mosaic/vignettes/ggformula-lattice.pdf

## Mosaic paper

Pruim R, Kaplan DT and Horton NJ (2017). The mosaic Package: Helping
Students to 'Think with Data' Using R. *The R Journal*, 9(1), pp.
77-102.  https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-024/index.html.

Abstract: The mosaic package provides a simplified and systematic introduction to the core functional ity related to descriptive statistics, visualization, modeling, and simulation-based inference required in first and second courses in statistics. This introduction to the package describes some of the guiding principles behind the design of the package and provides illustrative examples of several of the most important functions it implements. These can be combined to help students 'think with data' using R in their early course work, starting with simple, yet powerful, declarative commands.

## Project MOSAIC Little Books

The following longer documents are available at 
[github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/LittleBooks](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/LittleBooks/blob/master/README.md).

 * *Start Teaching Statistics Using R* includes 
some strategies for teaching beginners, and introduction to the `mosaic` package,
and some additional things that instructors should know about using R.

 * *[A Student's Guide to R](http://project-mosaic-books.com/?page_id=24)* provides a brief introduction to 
the R commands needed for all the basic statistical procedures in 
an Intro Stats course.


 * *[Start R in Calculus](http://project-mosaic-books.com/?page_id=22)* highlights features 
of R and the `mosaic` package that can be used to teach 
calculus with R.

 * *Start Modeling in R* (coming soon).
