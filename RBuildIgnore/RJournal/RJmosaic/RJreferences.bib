abstract = {This paper proposes a scientific model to explain the analysis
process. We argue that data analysis is primarily a procedure to build
understanding, and as such, it dovetails with the cognitive processes of the
human mind. Data analysis tasks closely resemble the cognitive process known as
sensemaking. We demonstrate how data analysis is a sensemaking task adapted to
use quantitative data. This identification highlights a universal structure
within data analysis activities and provides a foundation for a theory of data
analysis. The competing tensions of cognitive compatibility and scientific
rigour create a series of problems that characterise the data analysis process.
These problems form a useful organising model for the data analysis task while
allowing methods to remain flexible and situation dependent. The insights of
this model are especially helpful for consultants, applied statisticians and
teachers of data analysis.},

@book{Salsburg:2002,
    abstract = {{Science is inextricably linked with mathematics. Statistician David Salsburg examines the development of ever-more-powerful statistical methods for determining scientific truth in <I>The Lady Tasting Tea</I>, a series of historical and biographical sketches that illuminate without alienating the mathematically timid. Salsburg, who has worked in academia and industry and has met many of the major players he writes about, shares his subjects' enthusiasm for problem solving and deep thinking. His sense of excitement drives the prose, but never at the expense of the reader; if anything, the author has taken pains to eliminate esoterica and ephemera from his stories. This might frustrate a few number-head readers, but the abundant notes and references should keep them happy in the library for weeks after reading the book.<p>  Ultimately, the various tales herein are unified in a single theme: the conversion of science from observational natural history into rigorously defined statistical models of data collection and analysis. This process, usually only implicit in studies of scientific methods and history, is especially important now that we seem to be reaching the point of diminishing returns and are looking for new paradigms of scientific investigation. <I>The Lady Tasting Tea</I> will appeal to a broad audience of scientifically literate readers, reminding them of the humanity underlying the work.  <I>--Rob Lightner</I>} {At a summer tea party in Cambridge, England, a guest states that tea poured into milk tastes different from milk poured into tea. Her notion is shouted down by the scientific minds of the group. But one man, Ronald Fisher, proposes to scientifically test the hypothesis. There is no better person to conduct such an experiment, for Fisher is a pioneer in the field of statistics. The Lady Tasting Tea spotlights not only Fishers theories but also the revolutionary ideas of dozens of men and women which affect our modern everyday lives. Writing with verve and wit, David Salsburg traces breakthroughs ranging from the rise and fall of Karl Pearsons theories to the methods of quality control that rebuilt postwar Japans economy, including a pivotal early study on the capacity of a small beer cask at the Guinness brewing factory. Brimming with intriguing tidbits and colorful characters, The Lady Tasting Tea salutes the spirit of those who dared to look at the world in a new way.}},
