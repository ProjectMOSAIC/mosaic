\section{Introduction}

This document is intended to help describe how to undertake analyses introduced as examples in the Second Edition of the \emph{Statistical Sleuth} (2002) by Fred Ramsey and Dan Schafer.
More information about the book can be found at \url{http://www.proaxis.com/~panorama/home.htm}.

This work leverages initiatives undertaken by Project MOSAIC (\url{http://www.mosaic-web.org}), an NSF-funded project to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we utilize the mosaic package, which was written to simplify the use of R for introductory statistics courses. To use a package within R, it must be installed (one time), and loaded (each session). The package can be installed using the following command:
<<install_mosaic,eval=FALSE>>=
install.packages('mosaic')               # note the quotation marks
@
Once this is installed, it can be loaded by running the command:
<<load_mosaic,eval=FALSE>>=
require(mosaic)
@
This
needs to be done once per session.

We also set some options to improve legibility of graphs and output.
<<eval=TRUE>>=
trellis.par.set(theme=col.mosaic())  # get a better color scheme for lattice
options(digits=3)

\section{Discrimination Against the Handicapped}

Do equivalent candidates with the same qualifications but different disabilities get treated differentially?  This is the question addressed in case study 6.1 in the \emph{Sleuth}.  The goal of this document is to demonstrate how to calculate the quantities described in chapter 6 (linear combinations and multiple comparisons) using RStudio.

\subsection{Summary statistics and graphical display}

We begin by reading the data and summarizing the variables.

<<>>=
#p.150 of Sleuth
disability = read.csv("http://www.math.smith.edu/~nhorton/sleuth/case0601.csv")
summary(disability)
favstats(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability)
@

A total of \Sexpr{nrow(disability)} undergradate students from a U.S. university were randomly assigned to view 5 tapes, 14 to each tapes. The five kinds of the tapes are: NONE, AMPUTEE, CRUTCHES, HEARING and WHEELCHAIR. After reviewing the tape, each subject rated the qualifications of the application on 0-10 scale. Among the five hadicap conditions, the CRUTCHES group gave the highest mean score, while the HEARING group gave the lowest mean score. 

<<>>=
with(subset(disability, HANDICAP=="NONE"), stem(SCORE, scale=2))
with(subset(disability, HANDICAP=="AMPUTEE"), stem(SCORE, scale=2))
with(subset(disability, HANDICAP=="CRUTCHES"), stem(SCORE, scale=1))
with(subset(disability, HANDICAP=="HEARING"), stem(SCORE, scale=2))
with(subset(disability, HANDICAP=="WHEELCHAIR"), stem(SCORE, scale=2))

<<>>=
bwplot(HANDICAP ~ SCORE, data=disability)
@

<<>>=
densityplot(~SCORE, groups=HANDICAP, auto.key=TRUE, data=disability)
@

The stemplots show the applicant qualification scores given by objectives. The boxplots and the density plots show that all the distributions are normally distributed.

\subsection{One-way ANOVA}

First we fit the one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model, using all of the groups:

Calculation p.151
<<>>=
anova(lm(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability))
@

The p-value is \Sexpr{pval(anova(lm(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability)))}, which shows the evidence that subjects rate qualifications differently according to handicap status.

By default, the use of the linear model (regression) function displays the pairwise differences between the first group and each of the other groups.  Note that the overall test of the model is the same.

<<>>=
summary(lm(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability))
@

The reference group here is amputee, followed by crutches, hearing, none and wheelchair.

Another way of viewing these results is through a model table, which displays the differences between the grand mean and the group means.

<<>>=
model.tables(aov(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability))
@

Or by:

<<>>=
mean(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability)-mean(~ SCORE, data=disability)
@

\subsection{Contrasts and linear combination}

The Tucky-Kramer test is the most approporiate approach for these data.

Calculation on p.151
<<>>=
TukeyHSD(aov(lm(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability)), "HANDICAP", ordered=TRUE, c(0,1,-1,0,0), conf.level=0.95)
@

Based on the Tukey-Kramer procedure, the difference is estimated to be 1.87 points higher for the CRUTCHES tapes, with a 95\% confidence from 0.14 to 3.60.

Next, we calculate the comparison of AMPUTEE/HEARING to CRUTCHES/WHEELCHAIR

<<>>=
library(gmodels)
fit.contrast(lm(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability), "HANDICAP", c(-1, 1, -1, 0, 1), conf.int=0.95)
@

The t-value=\Sexpr{round(fit.contrast(lm(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability), "HANDICAP", c(-1, 1, -1, 0, 1), conf.int=0.95)[, "t value"], 2)} supports a difference between the average scores given to the WHEELCHAIR and CRUTCHES handicaps and the average scores given to the AMPUTEE and HEARING handicaps.

Calculation on p.155
<<>>=
fit.contrast(lm(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability), "HANDICAP", c(-0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 0, 0.5), conf.int=0.95)
@

Other multiple comparison procedures could also be implemented. The following shows the calculation on p.164
<<>>=
library(agricolae)
LSD.test(aov(lm(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability)), "HANDICAP")   # LSD
HSD.test(aov(lm(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability)), "HANDICAP")   # Tucky-Kramer
LSD.test(aov(lm(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability)), "HANDICAP", p.adj=c("bonferroni"))  # Bonferroni
scheffe.test(aov(lm(SCORE ~ HANDICAP, data=disability)), "HANDICAP")    # Scheffe
@

The "Significant Difference" in each test result is the "95\% interval half-width" referred in the book.

This comparision gives a sense about hot to choose the approporiate multiple comparisinos procedure.

\section{Pre-existing Preference of Fish}

Was Charles Darwin right that sexual selection is by females?  This is the question addressed in case study 6.2 in the \emph{Sleuth}.  The goal of this document is to demonstrate how to calculate the quantities described in chapter 6 (linear combinations and multiple comparisons) using RStudio.

\subsection{Summary statistics and graphical display}

We begin by reading the data and summarizing the variables.

<<>>=
#p.150 of Sleuth
fish = read.csv("http://www.math.smith.edu/~nhorton/sleuth/case0602.csv")
summary(fish)
favstats(PROPORTION ~ PAIR, data=fish)
@

A total of \Sexpr{nrow(fish)} female fish was involved in this experiment.

<<>>=
bwplot(PAIR ~ PROPORTION, data=fish)
@

<<>>=
densityplot(~PROPORTION, groups=PAIR, auto.key=TRUE, data=fish)
@

Besides the distribution of pair 5, all distributions of other pairs are approximately normally distributed. 

\subsection{One-way ANOVA}

First we fit the one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model, using all of the groups:

<<>>=
anova(lm(PROPORTION ~ PAIR, data=fish))
@

XX NOTE THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO EXTRACT THE P-VALUE MANUALLY: TRY EXAMINING THE OUTPUT OF SUMMARY(ANOVA()) XX

The p-value is \Sexpr{pval(anova(lm(PROPORTION ~ PAIR, data=fish)))}, which doesn't provide much evidence that the mean percentage of time with the yellow-sword male differed from one male pair to another.

By default, the use of the linear model (regression) function displays the pairwise differences between the first group and each of the other groups. Note that the overall test of the model is the same.

<<>>=
summary(lm(PROPORTION ~ PAIR, data=fish))
@

The reference group here is pair1, followed by pair 2-6.

Another way of viewing these results is through a model table, which displays the differences between the grand mean and the group means.

<<>>=
model.tables(aov(PROPORTION ~ PAIR, data=fish))
@

Or by:

<<>>=
mean(PROPORTION ~ PAIR, data=fish)-mean(~PROPORTION, data=fish)
@

\subsection{Contrasts and linear combination}

Calculation on p. 152 and p.158
<<>>=
library(gmodels)
lc=fit.contrast(lm(PROPORTION ~ PAIR, data=fish), "PAIR", c(5, -3, 1, 3, -9, 3), conf.int=0.95); lc
t=round(lc[, "t value"], 2); t
pt(t, 78, lower.tail=TRUE)
@

The t-value is \Sexpr{round(fit.contrast(lm(PROPORTION ~ PAIR, data=fish), "PAIR", c(5, -3, 1, 3, -9, 3), conf.int=0.95)[, "t value"], 2)} and the one-sided p-value is \Sexpr{round(pt(t, 78, lower.tail=TRUE), 2)}

XX We didn't find way to calculate the values shown in the following sentences: The mean percentage of time spent with the yellow-sword male is estimated to be 62.4\%. A 95\% confidence interval for the mean percentage is 59.0\% to 65.8\%. This is convincing evidence (one-sided $p-value<0.0001$ that the mean percentage exceeds the lack-of-perference value (50\%). XX
