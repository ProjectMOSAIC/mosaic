@article{Benford38,
	abstract = {It has been observed that the first pages of a table of common
	  logarithms show more wear than do the last pages, indicating that more
		used numbers begin with the digit 1 than with the digit 9. A
		compilation of some 20,000 first digits taken from widely divergent
		sources shows that there is a logarithmic distribution of first digits
		when the numbers are composed of four or more digits. An analysis of
		the numbers from different sources shows that the numbers taken from
		unrelated subjects, such as a group of newspaper items, show a much
		better agreement with a logarithmic distribution than do numbers from
		mathematical tabulations or other formal data. There is here the
		peculiar fact that numbers that individually are without relationship
		are, when considered in large groups, in good agreement with a
		distribution law-hence the name {"}Anomalous Numbers.{"} A further
		analysis of the data shows a strong tendency for bodies of numerical
		data to fall into geometric series. If the series is made up of numbers
		containing three or more digits the first digits form a logarithmic
		series. If the numbers contain only single digits the geometric
		relation still holds but the simple logarithmic relation no longer
		applies. An equation is given showing the frequencies of first digits
		in the different orders of numbers 1 to 10, 10 to 100, etc. The
		equation also gives the frequency of digits in the second, third...
		place of a multi-digit number, and it is shown that the same law
		applies to reciprocals. There are many instances showing that the
		geometric series, or the logarithmic law, has long been recognized as a
		common phenomenon in factual literature and in the ordinary affairs of
		life. The wire gauge and drill gauge of the mechanic, the magnitude
		scale of the astronomer and the sensory response curves of the
		psychologist are all particular examples of a relationship that seems
		to extend to all human affairs. The Law of Anomalous Numbers is thus a
		general probability law of widespread application.},

@book{Knuth:art2,
	abstract = {{Volume 2 of Donald Knuth's classic series The Art of Computer
	  Programming covers seminumerical algorithms, with topics ranging from
		random number generators to floating point operations and other
		optimized arithmetic algorithms. Truly comprehensive and meticulously
		written, this book (and series) is that rarest of all creatures--a work
		of authoritative scholarship in classical computer science, but one
		that can be read and used profitably by virtually all working
		programmers.

The book begins with fundamental questions regarding random numbers and how to
use algorithms to generate them. Subsequent chapters demonstrate efficient
computation of single-precision and double-precision arithmetic calculations
and modular arithmetic. The text then presents prime factorization (which can
	be used in cryptography, for instance) and algorithms for calculating
fractions. This volume ends with algorithms for polynomial arithmetic and
manipulation of power-series topics, which will benefit those with some
knowledge of calculus.

Throughout this beautifully presented edition, Knuth incorporates hundreds of
useful exercises for trying out the algorithms. These range from simple
problems to larger research project topics. (The book provides answers, where
	appropriate, at the end of the book.) The result is a text that's suitable
for college or graduate-level computer science courses or individual study by
  programmers. Volume 2 is an indispensable part of any working programmer's
	library.}},

	 abstract = {The usual test that a sample comes from a distribution of
		 given form is performed by counting the number of observations falling
			 into specified cells and applying the chi-squared test to these
			 frequencies. In estimating the parameters for this test, one may
			 use the maximum likelihood (or equivalent) estimate based (1) on
			 the cell frequencies, or (2) on the original observations. This
			 paper shows that in (2), unlike the well known result for (1), the
			 test statistic does not have a limiting chi-squared-distribution, but that
			 it is stochastically larger than would be expected under the chi-squared
			 theory. The limiting distribution is obtained and some examples
			 are computed. These indicate that the error is not serious in the
			 case of fitting a Poisson distribution, but may be so for the
			 fitting of a normal.},

Obese women have lower family incomes than women whose weight-for-height is in the "recommended" range. Results for men are weaker and mixed. We find similar results when we compare same-sex siblings in order to control for family background (for example, social class) differences. Differences in economic status by body mass for women increase markedly when we use an earlier weight measure or restrict the sample to persons who were single and childless when the early weight was reported. There is some evidence of labor market discrimination against obese women. Differences in marriage probabilities and spouse's earnings, however, account for 50 to 95 percent of their lower economic status. There is little evidence that obese African American women suffer an economic penalty relative to other African American women.},

For the purposes of this article, SAT Verbal and SAT Mathematical scores were placed on recentered scales, which have reporting ranges of 920 to 980, means of 950, and standard deviations of 11. (The 920-to-980 scale is used in this article to highlight the distinction between it and the old 200-to-800 scale. In actuality, recentered scores were reported on a 200-to-800 scale.) Recentering was accomplished via a linear transformation of normally distributed scores that were obtained from a continuized, smoothed frequency distribution of original SAT scores that were originally on augmented two-digit scales (i.e., discrete scores rounded to either 0 or 5 in the third decimal place). These discrete scores were obtained for all students in the 1990 Reference Group using 35 different editions of the SAT spanning October 1988 to June 1990. The performance of this 1990 Reference Group on the original and recentered scales is described. The effects of recentering on scores of individuals and the 1990 Reference Group are also examined. Finally, recentering did not occur solely on the basis of its technical merit. Issues associated with converting recentering from a possibility into a reality are discussed.},

			Finland. Chromosome 20 showed our strongest initial evidence for
			linkage. It currently has a maximum logarithm of odds (LOD) score
			of 2.48 at 70 cM in a set of 495 families. In this study, we
			searched for diabetes susceptibility variant(s) at 20q13 by
			genotyping single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in case and
			control DNA pools. Of 291 SNPs successfully typed in a 7.5-Mb
			interval, the strongest association confirmed by individual
			genotyping was with SNP rs2144908, located 1.3 kb downstream of the
			primary beta-cell promoter P2 of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha
			(HNF4A). This SNP showed association with diabetes disease status
			(odds ratio [OR] 1.33, 95\% CI 1.06-1.65, P = 0.011) and with
			several diabetes-related traits. Most of the evidence for linkage
			at 20q13 could be attributed to the families carrying the risk
			allele. We subsequently found nine additional associated SNPs
			spanning a 64-kb region, including the P2 and P1 promoters and
			exons 1-3. Our results and the independent observation of
			association of SNPs near the P2 promoter with diabetes in a
			separate study population of Ashkenazi Jewish origin suggests that
			variant(s) located near or within HNF4A increases susceptibility to
			type 2 diabetes.}

			and 50 controls for polymorphisms associated with AMD. Among
			116,204 single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped, an intronic and
			common variant in the complement factor H gene (CFH) is strongly
			associated with AMD (nominal P value <10-7). In individuals
			homozygous for the risk allele, the likelihood of AMD is increased
			by a factor of 7.4 (95\% confidence interval 2.9 to 19).
			Resequencing revealed a polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with
			the risk allele representing a tyrosine-histidine change at amino
			acid 402. This polymorphism is in a region of CFH that binds
			heparin and C-reactive protein. The CFH gene is located on
