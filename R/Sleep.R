#' @details
#' In an experiment on memory (Mednicj et al, 2008), students were given lists
#' of 24 words to memorize.  After hearing the words they were assigned at
#' random to different groups. One group of 12 students took a nap for 1.5 hours
#' while a second group of 12 students stayed awake and was given a caffeine
#' pill.  The data set records the number of words each participant was
#' able to recall after the break.
