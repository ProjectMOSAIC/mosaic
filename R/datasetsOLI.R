#' Average Gestation Period
#' 
#' The average gestation period, or time of pregnancy, of an animal is closely related to its longevity (the length of its lifespan.) Data on the average gestation period and longevity (in captivity) of 40 different species of animals have been examined, with the purpose of examining how the gestation period of an animal is related to (or can be predicted from) its longevity.

#' Baby Cry Count and IQ
#' 
#' A method for predicting IQ as soon as possible after birth could be important for early intervention in cases such as brain abnormalities or learning disabilities. It has been thought that greater infant vocalization (for instance, more crying) is associated with higher IQ. In 1964, a study was undertaken to see if IQ at 3 years of age is associated with amount of crying at newborn age. In the study, 38 newborns were made to cry after being tapped on the foot, and the number of distinct cry vocalizations within 20 seconds was counted. The subjects were followed up at 3 years of age and their IQs were measured.

#' Birth Weights of Newborns
#' 
#' Some studies suggest that women having their first baby at age 35 or older are at increased risk of having a baby with a low birth weight. A medical researcher wanted to estimate the mean weight back in the population of newborns who are the first child for women over the age of 35. To this end, the researcher chose a random sample of 125 women age 35 or older who were pregnant with their first child and followed them through the pregnancy. The datafile linked below contains the birth weight (in grams) of the 125 newborns (women pregnant with more than one child were excluded from the study).

#' Preferences for Computer Software

#' A local internet service provider (ISP) created two new versions of its software, with alternative ways of implementing a new feature. To find the product that would lead to the highest satisfaction among customers, the ISP conducted an experiment comparing user preference for the two new versions versus the existing software.  The ISP ideally wants to find out which of the three software products causes the highest user satisfaction. It has identified three major potential lurking variables that might affect user satisfaction: gender, age, and hours per week of computer use.

#' Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF) and Eye Color
#' 
#' There is various flickering light in our environment; for instance, light from computer screens and fluorescent bulbs. If the frequency of the flicker is below a certain threshold, the flicker can be detected by the eye. Different people have slightly different flicker "threshold" frequencies (known as the "critical flicker frequency," or CFF). Knowing the critical threshold frequency below which flicker is detected can be important for product manufacturing as well as tests for ocular disease. Do people with different eye color have different threshold flicker sensitivity? A 1973 study ("The effect of iris color on critical flicker frequency," Journal of General Psychology [1973], 91-95) obtained the following data from a random sample of subjects.

#' Risk Factors for Low Birth Weight
#' 
#' Low birth weight is an outcome that has been of concern to physicians for years. This is due to the fact that infant mortality rates and birth defect rates are very high for babies with low birth weight. A woman's behavior during pregnancy (including diet, smoking habits, and obtaining prenatal care) can greatly alter her chances of carrying the baby to term and, consequently, of delivering a baby of normal birth weight. The goal of the study was to identify risk factors associated with giving birth to a low birth weight baby.

#' Gosset's Experiment on Regular and Kiln-Dried Seeds
#' 
#' William S. Gosset was employed by the Guinness brewing company of Dublin. Sample sizes available for experimentation in brewing were necessarily small, and new techniques for handling the resulting data were needed. Gosset consulted Karl Pearson (1857-1936) of University College in London, who told him that the current state of knowledge was unsatisfactory. Gosset undertook a course of study under Pearson and the outcome of his study was perhaps the most famous paper in statistical literature, "The Probable Error of a Mean" (1908), which introduced the t distribution. Since Gosset was contractually bound by Guinness, he published under a pseudonym, "Student," hence the t distribution is often referred to as Student's t distribution.
#' 
#' As an example to illustrate his analysis, Gosset reported in his paper on the results of seeding 11 different plots of land with two different types of seed: "regular" and "kiln-dried". There is reason to believe that drying seeds before planting will increase plant yield. Since different plots of soil may be naturally more fertile, this confounding variable was eliminated by using the matched pairs design and planting both types of seed in all 11 plots.
#' 
#' The hypothesis is that kiln-dried seed yields more corn than regular seed.

#' Sleeping Time of Undergraduate and Graduate Students
#' 
#' A study was conducted at a large state university in order to compare the sleeping habits of undergraduate students to those of graduate students. Random samples of 75 undergraduate students and 50 graduate students were chosen and each of the subjects was asked to report the number of hours he or she sleeps in a typical day. The hypothesis is that since undergraduate students are generally younger and party more during their years in school, they sleep less, on average, than graduate students.

#' TV Time 1
#' 
#' A researcher wanted to study whether or not men and women differ in the amount of time they watch TV during a week. A random sample of 40 adults was chosen (22 of whom were women and 18 of whom were men). At the end of the week, each of the 40 subjects reported the total amount of time (in minutes) that he or she watched TV during that week.
